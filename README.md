# grpsite-master
Master repo for the collaboration site.

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789

You can also reference the repositories:

githubuser/repository#issue_number

you can use these synonyms to reference an issue and close it (in your commit message):

fix #xxx
fixes #xxx
fixed #xxx
close #xxx
closes #xxx
closed #xxx
resolve #xxx
resolves #xxx
resolved #xxx
You can also substitute #xxx with gh-xxx.

Referencing and closing issues across repos also works:

fixes user/repo#xxx
Check out the documentation available in their Help section.
